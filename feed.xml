<p>If in doubt, simplify, said someone, somewhere, once. So I took out the AI-generated header image and removed most of the colour. That has certainly helped to improve the look of the site. A few additional tweaks and it's better already.</p>
<p>I added a new icon for the header: disguise.png, which I credit to <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/birthday-and-party" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">smashingstocks - Flaticon</a></p>

                    Publii is the static site generator I've been testing out. A static site generator enables you to publish a website or blog without needing a database in the back-end. A site is really just a collection of pages that can be written in markdown. There's no interactive functionality that depends on Javascript or similar, hence 'static'. It's been interesting to see just how easy it is to publish a blog on GitHub Pages, using Publii as the CMS. But now I've tried it I can't help thinking that Publii is a little too constraining for my tastes.

<p>Let's face it, this site isn't exactly the most beautiful thing in existence, but it's hard to improve its looks.</p>
<p>Things are a little too hard to tweak, but I want to get the layout exactly as I want it, not as the CMS forces me.</p>
<p>That means it's probably time to try a different static site generator.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of trying out Hugo, which I can probably just plug into GitHub pages, although I seem to remember GitHub was promoting the use of Jekyll. </p>
<p>So this site might go quiet for a while, for me to concentrate on learning how to deploy a site with Hugo.</p>
<p>And I'll report back as soon as there's something to report.</p>

<p>AI art is coming on in leaps and bounds, but midjourney is the first exeplar that has really made me sit up and take notice. In my opinion, it’s creating a whole new way of looking at the world, which is what all good art does.</p>
<p>AI art doesn’t really put human artists out of a job, any more than acrylic paint did, or synthetic paintbrushes, or photography. It just makes everyone anxious at first, then becomes just another tool for humans to make use of.</p>
<p>A while ago I quoted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must get used to being less clever than the artificial brain that we have produced, just as our teeth are less strong than a millstone and our ability to fly negligible compared with that of a jet aircraft.” </p>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Already there are digital artists making AI-assisted art. It’s a trend that will keep getting stronger, and I think we’ve only just begun to see what’s possible.</p>

I’m especially interested in your experiences of static web sites and other CMS options such as WordPress, whether as a reader, a writer, or a developer.</p>
<p>That brings me to the subject of this post: comments.</p>
<p>Until now, Publii was pretty bare-bones, and like all static websites, didn’t have a comments option. This is because comments require some kind of dynamic interactions that a static website just isn’t up to. Usually this involves Javascript, which static sites can’t easily handle.</p>
<p>But now there’s a new version of Publii which has plugins. At this early point the plugins that are available will provide a static site with analytics and/or comments. </p>
<p>I’m not a fan of Facebook comments or Disqus comments because of the way they suck up all your data and spread it around. They are great examples of the old saying that if you’re not paying, you’re the product. But there’s a plugin for a lightweight comment system I’d never heard of before, called <a href="https://cusdis.com/">Cusdis</a>. I might just give it a go. On the other hand, it seems to be still in early development. Furthermore, I’m still not convinced of the benefits of a static site if it then also relies on non-static add-onns. Perhaps you might as well go back to a more dynamic CMS. Clearly I’m confused and still working this one out!</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://getpublii.com/blog/release-039.html">Publii 0.39 announcement</a> for all the details.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ol>
<li>Very simple. </li>
<li>It just works. </li>
<li>Also, the idea is that the editor gets out of your way. Nothing to distract from just writing.</li>
<li>You can keep your fingers on the keyboard and add simple styling using Markdown conventions such as <strong>bold</strong> text. There are keyboard shortcuts for just about everything, as listed on the <a href="https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor#keyboard-shortcuts">SimpleMDE  ReadMe page</a></li>
<li>It’s just a simple Markdown editor, though, so extensions such as <del>strikethrough</del> probably don’t work. Update: They do. Perhaps all <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">Github Flavoured Markdown</a> conventions will work. Need to check. Update: Looks like SimpleMDE uses <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GFM</a>.</li>
