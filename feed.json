This is because comments require some kind of dynamic interactions that a static website just isn’t up to. Usually this involves Javascript, which static sites can’t easily handle.</p>\n<p>But now there’s a new version of Publii which has plugins. At this early point the plugins that are available will provide a static site with analytics and/or comments. </p>\n<p>I’m not a fan of Facebook comments or Disqus comments because of the way they suck up all your data and spread it around. They are great examples of the old saying that if you’re not paying, you’re the product. But there’s a plugin for a lightweight comment system I’d never heard of before, called <a href=\"https://cusdis.com/\">Cusdis</a>. I might just give it a go. On the other hand, it seems to be still in early development. Furthermore, I’m still not convinced of the benefits of a static site if it then also relies on non-static add-onns. Perhaps you might as well go back to a more dynamic CMS. Clearly I’m confused and still working this one out!</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/blog/release-039.html\">Publii 0.39 announcement</a> for all the details.</p>\n",
