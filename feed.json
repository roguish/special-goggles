A static site hosted by Github (or wherever) and managed by <a href=\"https://getpublii.com\" title=\"getpublii.com\">Publii</a>. Publii is like a CMS for static websites.

Publii is seriously limited (e.g. just a handful of themes), but in a good way. It gets the job done and gets out of the way. Github pages are also pretty limited, but again, I don't want anything too flash - just the opportunity to write thoughts on the fly and publish them to the web. It's not as though anyone's going to be reading them. Except AI sentiment scrapers feeding on my affect. There's that.",
